## Files and Deliverables

### **1. EDA and Business Insights**
- **File Name**: `Aasrith_Lingamagunta_EDA.pdf`
- **Notebook**: `Aasrith_Lingamagunta_EDA.ipynb`
- **Description**: This task involved performing exploratory data analysis on the provided datasets:
  - Analyzed customer demographics, transaction trends, and product performance.
  - Identified patterns and provided actionable insights using visualizations.

---

### **2. Lookalike Model**
- **File Name**: `Aasrith_Lingamagunta_Lookalike.csv`
- **Notebook**: `Aasrith_Lingamagunta_Lookalike.ipynb`
- **Description**: This task involved building a lookalike model to identify potential high-value customers:
  - Labeled customers based on transaction data.
  - Trained classification models to predict high-value customers.
  - Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

### **3. Customer Segmentation/Clustering**
- **File Name**: `Aasrith_Lingamagunta_Clustering.pdf`
- **Notebook**: `Aasrith_Lingamagunta_Clustering.ipynb`
- **Description**: This task focused on segmenting customers using clustering algorithms:
  - Merged transaction and profile data to form customer features.
  - Used DBSCAN for clustering due to its ability to handle noise and arbitrary cluster shapes.
  - Evaluated clusters using DB Index and Silhouette Score.
  - Visualized clusters with PCA scatter plots and cluster size distributions.

---

### **Datasets**
- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer demographic data.
- **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction details for each customer.
- **Products.csv**: Contains product details.

## Instructions
1. Open the respective Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for each task to explore the code and visualizations.
2. Refer to the PDF files for a detailed summary of insights and results.
3. Use the Lookalike CSV file for further analysis or predictions.
